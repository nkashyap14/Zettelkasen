# RSS

## Definition:

- Sum of the squares of the residuals (deviations predicted from actual empirical values of data)
- Measure of the discrepancy between data and an estimation model like [[linear regression]]

$$
RSS = \sum^{n}_{i=1}{(y_i -f(x_i))^2}
$$
$$
RSS = \sum^{n}_{i=1}{(x_i*w -f(x_i))^2}
$$

-  y_i is a label and x_i is a data observation and w is a corresponding weight
