# Multiple Random Variables

$$
p_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z) = p_X(x)*p_{Y|X}(y|x)*p_{Z|X,Y}(z|x,y)
$$

- Random Variables X, Y, and Z are independent if 
$$
p_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z) = p_X(x)*p_Y(y)*p_Z(z) \forall x,y,z
$$

- Or intuitively Random Variables are independent if having information about one of the variables does not change our beliefs about the likelihoods of various values for the remaining random variables
