# Ridge Regression

## Definition:

- [[least squares regression]] models can be highly sensitive to noise when features are linearly correlated and real life data tends to have noise
- To combat this we perform [[regularization]]
	- Specifically [[L2 Regularization (Ridge)]]
	- This is because ridge regression ends up being far less influenced by added noise compared to [[least squares regression]]
- [[RidgeRegression sklearn]]
