# Standard Normal Distribution

- Phenomenons in which a certain quantity is measured and that quantity is made up of lots of random contributions / independent [[Random Variable|random variables]] then the distribution tends to take the form of a normal distribution
$$
f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2}
$$
$$
E[X] = 0, var(X) = 1
$$

- General normal:
$$
N(\mu,\sigma^2) = f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2}
$$
$$
E[X] = \mu, var(X) = \sigma^2
$$
- Linear functions of normal random variables are themselves normal simply scale
- Above formula's still only give us density's. we want to use them to calculate probabilities aka [[Cumulative Distribution Function]] of the normal distributions
