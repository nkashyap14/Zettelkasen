# Shared-Nothing Architecture

- Sometimes called horizontal scaling or scaling out
- Under this approach each machine or virtual machine running database software counts as a [[node]]
	- Each node uses its CPU's, RAM, and disks independently
- No special hardware required
- Able to distribute data across multiple geographic regions and reduce [[Latency]] for end users
- Coordination done between nodes is at a software level using a [[network]]
- Also incurs additional complexity + can limit the expressiveness of the data models we use
