# Independence

- Occurrence of event A provides no  information about event B

$$
 P(B \mid A) = {P(B)} 
$$
- Results in 
$$
 P(A \cap B) = {P(B)}*{P(A \mid B)} 
$$

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) * P(B)
$$

- Usually arises from two distinct physical phenomena that do not have effects on each other
- Mutually exclusive events are not independent. Because knowing one occurs allows us to know the other doesn't occur. Aka occurrence of one event affects our beliefs about the other.
- Conditional Independence
	$$
P(A \cap B \mid C) = P(A \mid C) * P(B \mid C)
$$
- Independence of multiple events:
	- Information on some of the events tells us nothing about probabilities related to the remaining events
	- Events are jointly independent if we can find the probability of their joint occurrence by multiplying their individual probabilities together
