# Asymmetric encryption

- Involves the use of a [[public key]] for [[encryption]] and a [[private key]] for [[decryption]]
- The public key is distributed to those who want to send encrypted messages while the private key is kept secret by the owner
- Utilized for establishingn secure connections in protocols like [[TLS]]/[[SSL]], [[HTTPS]]
- The risks involve with ensuring that the message that comes in from a public key can actually be tied back to the party you expect it to link too
