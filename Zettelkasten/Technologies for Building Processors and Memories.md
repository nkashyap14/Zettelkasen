# Technologies for Building Processors and Memories

## General Details

- Manufacture of a chip begins with [[silicon]] which is a [[semiconductor]]
- Add materials to silicon that allow tiny areas to transform into one of 3 devices:
	- Excellent conductors of electricity
	- Excellent [[insulators]] of electricity
	- Areas that can conduct or insulate under special conditions (as a switch)
		- Transistors in this category
- Process starts with a [[silicon crystal ingot]]
- Ingot gets sliced into [[wafer|wafers]]
- Then processing steps occur during which patterns of chemicals are placed on each wafer creating the three types of devices above
- Wafers are chopped up into [[Integrated Circuit|chips/dies]]

## Subtopics

- [[Cost of An Integrated Circuit]]
## Terms defined

- [[Transistor]]
- [[Very Large-Scale Integrated Circuit (VLSI)]]
- [[Yield (Dies)]]
