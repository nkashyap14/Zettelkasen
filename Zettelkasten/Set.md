# Set

- Collection of objects each individual object being an element
$$
\emptyset = Empty Set
$$
$$
A \in S
$$
$$
A \notin S
$$

- Above two show how to say A is an element in set S and not an element in set S
$$
S = [x | X satisfies P]
$$
- | reads as such that
$$
S \subset S*
$$
$$
S \supset S*
$$
$$
\mathbb{R}
$$
$$
\mathbb{R^2}
$$
- above represents set of real numbers and secondn  is the set of pairs of scalars aka two dimensional plane
