# Covariance

-Covariance is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two variables change together
-A positive covariance means the variables tend to show similar behavior aka when one increases the other increases
-Conversely if the greater values of one variable correspond to mainly lesser values of the other the covariance is negative, indicating that variables tend to move in the opposite directions
-Covariance is calculated as the sum of the products of the deviations of each pair of values from their respective meanns divided by the number of data points minus 1.
$$
-\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{n-1}
$$

where:
- \(X_i\) and \(Y_i\) are the individual sample points indexed with \(i\),
- \(\bar{X}\) and \(\bar{Y}\) are the means of the \(X\) and \(Y\) datasets, respectively,
- \(n\) is the number of data points.
