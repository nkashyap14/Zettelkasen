# Total Expectation Theorem

- Partition of [[Sample Space]] into disjoint events $$A_1,A_2,...,A_n$$
- There exists an event B that can happen under any of those scenarios
$$
P(B) = P(A_1)*P(B|A_1) + ... + P(A_n)*P(B|A_n)
$$

$$
E[X] = P(A_1)E[X|A_1] + .... + P(A_n)*E[X|A_n]
$$

- Overall average value of is a weighted linear combination of the expected value of X under the different scenarios
