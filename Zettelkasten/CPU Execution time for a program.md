# CPU Execution time for a program

## Definition:

$$
CPU Execution Time=CPU Clock Cycles for a program * Clock Period
$$
- Or because [[clock rate]] and clock period are inverses

$$
CPU Exec Time = \frac{CPU Clock Cycles}{Clock Rate}
$$

- Hardware designer can improve performance or execution time by reducing the number of clock cycles for a program or by reducing the length of the [[Clock Period]]

$$
CPU Clock Cycles = Instructions for a program * Average Clock Cycles Per Instruction
$$
$$
CPU Times = Instruction Count * CPI * Clock Cycle Time
$$
- And since clock rate is the inverse of clock cycle time
$$
CPU Times = \frac{Instruction Count * CPI}{Clock Rate}
$$
