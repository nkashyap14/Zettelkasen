# Defensive Options Drill

- [[Parry]] Orthodox Jab:
	- [[Southpaw]]: [[Kickboxing Fundamental Stance]] from the start. Right hand shifts from the right temple ever so slightly and taps the [[Orthodox Jab]] coming towards the face
- [[Slip]] Orthodox Jab:
	- [[Southpaw]] : Slipping to the right.
		- This leads me to have options in a combat scenario to return with
			- [[Lead Southpaw Hook]]
			- [[Lead Southpaw Jab]] alongside with a step to the outside circling
			- [[Lead Southpaw Upper]]
- [[Roll]] Orthodox Jab:
	- [[Southpaw]] :
		- Left/Back leg goes to the left first
		- Right leg follows the horizontal movement
		- Head swings down and body drops towards earth
- [[Stance Switch]]:
	- [[Southpaw]]:
		- Right foot moves backward and left foot becomes the pivoting fulcrum
		- Send a left hand forward in the same motion to create distance
		- Keep Right hand on chin in order to be viligant for any strikes creeping up to the head
