# Conditional Probability

- Can be viewed as a probability law on a new universe B
- Probabilities that apply after the revision of our beliefs after we're given some information


$$
 P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{|A\cap B|}{|B|}
$$
	- third part only applies if the sets A and B are finitely many and equally likely

- Equates to:
	- Means that the probability of the world where a and b occurs is equal to the probability of B occurring multiplied by the probability of the world where A occurs when we know B occurs
	- Find the probability of a composite event by multiplying probabilities and conditional probabilities
$$
 P(A \cap B) = {P(B)}*{P(A \mid B)} 
$$

- Conditional Probabilities also have [[Countable additivity axiom]]
	$$
	 P(A \cup B \mid C) = {P(A \mid C)} + {P(B \mid C)} 
	$$
- Conditional probabilities are always proportional to original probabilities
