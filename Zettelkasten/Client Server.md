# Client Server

- Two layered and typically two tiered architecture
- Distributed program in which clients and servers communicate directly with each other
- Client has the user interface code while the server contains the database. Both the server and the client can contain business logic
	- Majority of it is on the server
- Pros:
	- Improved performance as you distribute processing tasks between the client and server
	- Better security as server is separate then the client
	- Centralized management of data and resources making it easier to maintain and update the application
	- Easy scalability offerings by adding more clients and servers to the network
- Cons:
	- Dependence on a central server
	- Can be more complex as this requires both client and server components to be set up 
	- Requires on network communication which can be a limiting factor
	- Cost can be higher as it requires specialized software and hardware
