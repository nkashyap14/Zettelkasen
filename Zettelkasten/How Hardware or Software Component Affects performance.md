# How Hardware or Software Component Affects performance

## General Details

- [[Zettelkasten/Algorithm]]
	- Affects [[Clock Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)]] and also total count of [[Instruction]]s
	- Determines the number of source program instructions executed and hence the number of processor instructions executed
	- Affects CPI as if it favors certain techniques it can raise the CPI as it requires more resources
- [[Zettelkasten/Programming Language]]
	- Affects instruction count and the [[Clock Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)]]
	- Statements in language are translated to processor instructions which determine the count
	- Languages like Java at higher levels will require more indirect calls and raise [[Clock Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)]]
- [[Compiler]]
	- Efficiency of the compilter affects instruction count and also [[Clock Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)]]
- [[Instruction Set Architecture]]
	- Determines the instruction count, [[clock rate]] and also the [[Clock Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)]]
