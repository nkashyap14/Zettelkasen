# Configure a sampling method

## Notes:

- Specific values used in a [[sweep job]] depend on the type off sampling used
- Types:
	- [[Grid Sampling (Azure Machine Learning)]]: Tries every possible combination
	- [[Random sampling (Azure Machine Learning)]]: Randomly chooses values from the search space
		- Sobol: adds a seed to random sampling to make the results reproducible
	- [[Bayesian Sampling (Azure Machine Learning)]]: Chooses new values based on previous results
