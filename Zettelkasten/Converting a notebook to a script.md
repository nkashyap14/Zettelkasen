# Converting a notebook to a script

## Notes:

- Remove all nonessential code
	- remove code that was included for exploratory purposes like print() or df.describe() statements
	- Want to remove anything nonessential to reduce cost and compute time
- Refactor code into functions
- Test scripts beforehand
	- Run it in terminal of the compute instance
