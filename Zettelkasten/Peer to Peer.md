# Peer to Peer

- Architectural style of a decentralized network where the nodes act as both a client and server at the same time
- Workload is distributed amongst various peers in the system
- No need for a centralized server like there is in a [[Client Server|Client Server Architecture]]
- Several types:
	- Pure: All nodes equal and no central server or authority
	- Hybrid: Some nodes might have special roles or responsibilities
	- Structured: Nodes are organized into a specific structure to facilitate resource discovery and communication
- Applications:
	- File sharing:
		- Users can download and upload files directly from each others computers
	- Distributed computing: Distribute tasks and workloads across multiple computers
	- Online gaming: 
	- Communication and messaging: Skpe/Whatsapp
	- Digital currency: Decentralized digital currencies like bitcoin use P2P networks to facilitate and maintain a distributed ledger of all transactions
	- Cloud storage: P2P networks can create decentralized cloud storage systems allowing users to store and access data on each others networks
- Pros:
	- Decentralization: 
	- Scalability
	- Resource sharing
	- Privacy
	- Fault Tolerance: No central point of failure
	- Lower costs
- Disadvantages:
	- Security vulnerabilities if nodes are not properly secured
	- Resource discvoery: Hard to discover and locate resources for a node as no central discovery service
	- Coordination can be difficult
	- Legal issues
	- Quality of service might not be same as traditional client server network
