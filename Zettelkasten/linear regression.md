# linear regression

## Definition:

- Statistical model which estimates the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables (independent variable/regressor)
- Since finding an optimal model for a dataset is hard usually we attempt to find an approximating distribution and in many cases a linear model like Linear regression can approximate the data well
$$
y = ax_1 + bx_2 + cx_3 + d
$$
- x's are independent variables
- y is the dependent variable
- a, b, c and intercept d determine the model's fit
- Simplest form of linear regression is [[least squares regression]]
