# Basic Performance Equation

## Definition:

$$
CPU time = Instruction Count*CPI*ClockCycleTime
$$

	- Clock Cycle Time : Time per Clock Cycle
	- CPI = Clock Cycles Per Instruction
- [[clock rate]] is the inverse of clock cycle time or [[Clock Period]]
$$
CPU Time = \frac{Instruction Count * CPI}{ClockRate}
$$

- How units work out
$$
Time = \frac{Seconds}{Program} = \frac{Instructions}{Program}*\frac{Clock Cycles}{Instruction}*\frac{Seconds}{Clock Cycle}
$$
