# OLAP

- Online Analytics Processing
- Aggregates over a large number of records for read pattern
- Bulk imports or event streams for write pattern
- Used by internal analysts for decision supports
- feeds into [[business intelligence]] tools
- Data represents a history of events that happened over time
- Terabytes to petabytes sized data
- Initially used [[relational database]]'s for analytics however eventually there was a trend to stop using [[OLTP]] systems for analytics and run it on a separate database instead which came to be known as a [[Data warehouse]]
