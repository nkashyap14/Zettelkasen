# Graph Database

- Type of data model where data is modeled as a graph
- 2 types of objects:
	- Vertices
		- Node
		- Entity
	- Edges
		- relationship
		- arc
	- Types of data that can be modeled as a graph:
		- Social Graph
			- Nodes are people, edges indicate relationships
		- Web graph
		- Road or rail networks
- Property Graph model:
	- Vertex consists of:
		- Unique identifier
		- Set of outgoing edges
		- Set of incoming edges
		- Collection of properties (key value pairs)
	- Edge consists of:
		- Unique identifier
		- Vertex which edge starts (tail vertex)
		- Vertex at which edge ends (head vertex)
		- Label to describe the relationship between the two vertexes
		- Collection of properties (key value pairs)
