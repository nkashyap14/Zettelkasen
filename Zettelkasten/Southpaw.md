# Southpaw

- In the domain of kickboxing, a southpaw stance refers to a fighter who positions their right foot forward, with their left foot and hand behind. This stance is the opposite of the orthodox stance, where the left foot is forward. Southpaw fighters typically use their right hand for [[jab|jabs]] and right foot for leading kicks, while the left hand and foot are reserved for power strikes and kicks. This stance is often advantageous for left-handed fighters and can create strategic challenges for opponents accustomed to facing orthodox fighters.
- Southpaw fighters tend to face [[orthodox]] fighters which tends to find them in the common fight scenario of a [[Mirror Matchup]]
