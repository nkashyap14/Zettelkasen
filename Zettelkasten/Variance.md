# Variance

- Second moment
$$E[X^2] = \sum(x^2 * p_{X}(x))$$
- Var(X) = E|(X - E[X])|^2 =
	- $$\sum_{x}(x - E[X])^2*p_{X}(x)$$
	- = 
	- E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
- Represents the averaged squared distance from the mean
- Also represents the average value of the inner random variable which is the squared distance from the mean 
- Variance is important as it is a measure of how spread out a distribution is
- Properties:
$$ var(X) >= 0 $$
$$ var(\alpha*X + \beta) = \alpha^2var(X)$$
