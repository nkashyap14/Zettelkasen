# Sample Space

- When running an experiment there is a list of all possible outcomes or a set of all possible outcomes
- That [[set]] represents the sample space which is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
- The sample space is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
	- Collectively exhaustive means that regardless of the result of the experiment one of the outcomes of the set comes 
	- Mutually exclusive means that because one event A took place from the sample space by nature the other events have not taken place
- represented by 
$$\Omega$$
