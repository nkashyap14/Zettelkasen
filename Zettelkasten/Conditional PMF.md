# Conditional PMF

- A is an event which has occurred. Below tells us the probability that event x from [[Sample Space]] X occurs conditioned on the event A occurring happens at said probability
$$
P_{X|Y}(x|y) = P(X=x|Y=y) = \frac{P(X = x, Y=y)}{P(Y= y)}
$$

- Can calculate the join pmf:
$$
P_{X,Y}(x,y) = P_Y(y)*P_{X|Y}(x|y)
$$
