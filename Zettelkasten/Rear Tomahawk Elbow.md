# Rear Tomahawk Elbow

- Rear arm gets raised almost up to the side of your head
	- Elbow should be raised to the side of the opponents head
- From there the elbow drops inward to the opponent and hits him from the side
- Footwork body mechanics should be similar to the [[rear cross]] where the lead leg points slightly off to the side and the rear leg heavily rotates with the ankle being elevated
