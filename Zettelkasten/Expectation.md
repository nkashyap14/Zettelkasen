# Expectation

- Represents the center of gravity in a [[Probability Mass Function|PMF]]
- In probability theory, the expectation of a random variable is a measure of its central tendency or average value, capturing the long-term behavior of the variable over repeated trials. 

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i} x_i P(X = x_i)
$$
$$
E[g(X,Y)] = \sum_x\sum_yg(x,y)*p_{X,Y}(x,y)
$$
- Average value of the function of a random variable is not equal to the function of the average except for linear exceptions
