# Spinning Elbow

- Lead leg steps across in parallel or basically in line with the bag / opponent
- Body rotates and the rear elbow lands
- From then there are 2 ways to post off
	- 1: With the elbow/hand that lands however this leads you to be in the opposite fighting position after posting off
		- [[Orthodox]] if starting [[Southpaw]]
		- [[Southpaw]] if starting [[Orthodox]]
	- 2: Rotate body into the natural position
		- This one will require attention to defense
		- This is one that comes to my body naturally however still needs to be determined if this is acceptable
