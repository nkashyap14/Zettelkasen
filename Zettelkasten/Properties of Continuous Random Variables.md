# Properties of Continuous Random Variables

- Basically same properties as the discrete case except we replace summations with integrals and wherever we had the probability mass function we throw in the probability density function

$$
E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty{x*f_X(x)*dx}
$$
$$
E[g(x)] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty{g(x)*f_X(x)*dx}
$$

$$
var(X) = \sigma_X^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty{(x - E[X])^2*f_X(x)*dx}
$$
