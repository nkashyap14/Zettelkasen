# Thread

- In every [[process]] there exist one or more common subelements called threads 
- Each thread has an independent path of execution
- The [[Operating System]] uses the [[task scheduler|scheduler]] to queue up threads for execution
- Threads that belong to the same process share the process's address space
- It is easier for the OS to switch amongst threads than between processes
- [[Thread Lifecycle]]
