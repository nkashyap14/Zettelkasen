# Linux

**Linux** is a free, open-source [[operating system]] based on Unix. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since evolved through contributions from developers worldwide. The core component of Linux is the [[kernel]], which manages hardware resources and provides essential services to applications.

### Key Features:

1. **[[Open Source]]**: The source code is freely available, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute it.
2. **Multi-user and Multitasking**: Supports multiple users and can run several processes simultaneously.
3. **Security**: Built-in security features and extensive community support contribute to its robustness.
4. **Flexibility**: Highly customizable, suitable for various applications from servers to desktops and embedded systems.

### Components:

- **Kernel**: The core part of the OS, managing hardware and system calls.
- **Shell**: Interface for users to interact with the system via commands.
- **File System**: Organizes and manages files and directories.

### Distributions:

Linux comes in various distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS, each tailored for specific uses with different pre-installed software and configurations.

### Usage:

Linux is widely used in servers, supercomputers, and mobile devices (via Android). Its stability, security, and flexibility make it a preferred choice for developers, enterprises, and enthusiasts.
