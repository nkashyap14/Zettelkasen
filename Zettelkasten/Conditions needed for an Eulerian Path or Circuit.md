| Undirected Graph | Every Vertex has an even degree                  | Either every vertex has even degree or exactly two vertices have odd degree (End + Start vertex)                                                                      |
| Directed Graph   | Every vertex has an equal indegree and outdegree | At most one vertex has (outdegree) - (indegree) = 1 and at most one vertex has (indegree) - (outdegree) = 1 and all other vertices have equal indegree and outdegrees |

- An additional requirement is that all vertices with non zero degree need to belong to a single connected component
