# Floyd Mayweather vs Arturo Gatti

## Context

## Notes

- Floyd hits a [[jab to the body]] at full extension and then goes straight back while baiting gotti in. Hits him with a [[lead hook]] as he comes in and then a power [[Boxing Cross]]
- Floyd's distance management is impeccable. Stays just out of range of gotti's jab so that he can return with his control
- This is an example of excellent hand speed matched with excellent form
- Floyd is more deliberate with his movements while Arturo gatti's over feinting with his lead hand which leaves room for floyd to exploit. The feints should be deliberately drilled and not haphazard
- Good combo from floyd where he sends a [[body cross]] into a [[body hook]] into a pivot around the body using his leverage into a pivot towards his cross side into a cross
	- larger part of the movement is done with his back leg. lead leg does a simple step over
	- almost sending his full body weight into the opponent with the lead hook
