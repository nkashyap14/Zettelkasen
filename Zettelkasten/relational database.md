# relational database

- A type of database that organizes [[data]] into one or more tables of rows and columns with a [[primary key|unique key]] identifying each row
- Allows for data to be easily organized and retrieved using [[SQL|Structured Query Language]]
- Query optimizer automatically decides which parts of the query to execute and in which order and what indexes to use
- Can handle simple types of many-to-many relationships but when dataset starts having large amounts of those relationships than it might be time to consider a [[Graph Database]]
