# binomial probability

- Probability for a specific event taking place in  a sequence of [[Independence|independent]] trials is the sum of the probability of all the events that make the outcome happen
$$
P(k heads) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$
-  (# of k head sequences out of n tries) * probability of k heads* probability of n - k opposite events
