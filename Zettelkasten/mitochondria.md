# mitochondria

- Membrane-bound organelles found in the [[cytoplasm]] of [[eukaryotic cells]]
- Known as the powerhouses of the cell
- Generate majority of the cell's supply of [[ATP]] a source of chemical energy
- Also involved in various other cellular processes
- Functions:
	- Energy Production: Through the process of oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria convert energy from nutrients into ATP.
	- Metabolic Roles: Involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle).
	- Regulation of Cellular Metabolism: Control the balance between energy production and consumption.
	- Calcium Storage: Store and release calcium ions, which are important for various cellular functions.
	- Apoptosis: Play a key role in programmed cell death, which is crucial for development and homeostasis.
	- Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Management: Involved in the production and detoxification of ROS, which are byproducts of cellular metabolism.
