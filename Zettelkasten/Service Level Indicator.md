# Service Level Indicator

- Carefully defined quantitative measure of an aspect of the level of service that has been provided
- Examples:
	- Request [[latency]] : [[response]] time to [[request]]
	- [[Error rate]] : Failed [[request]]s / total [[request]]s
	- System [[throughput]] : rate at which a [[Distributed System]] processes and completes tasks or the amount of work that a system can handle over a given period
	- [[Availability]] : Fraction of time a service is usable
	- [[Durability]] : Likelihood that the data will be retained over time
