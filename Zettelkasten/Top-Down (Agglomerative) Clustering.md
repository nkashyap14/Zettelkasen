# Top-Down (Agglomerative) Clustering

## Definition:

- Treats each data observation as its own cluster
- Then repeatedly merges the two most similar clusters until we reach the desired number of clusters
- [[Top-Down (Agglomerative) Clustering sklearn]]
- Can perform [[dimensionality reduction]] by using agglomerative clustering
	- Merge common features into clusters
	- Allows us to reduce total number of features while maintaining most of the original information from the dataset
	- Done by using [[FeatureAgglomeration sklearn]]
