# Horizontal Partitioning

- Involves splitting a table into multiple smaller tables, each table containing a percentage of the initial tables rows
- Limitation:
	- May need to access data from multiple nodes for requests that are searching for a range of rows
	- Harder to perform atomic operations over data that is partitioned horizontally
