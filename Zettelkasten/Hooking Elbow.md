# Hooking Elbow

- Start in [[Southpaw]] or [[orthodox|Orthodox]]
- Side of body that hits it all starts with the high guard
- With the rotation of the shoulder the hand should also be parallel
- The shoulder should rise up and connect to the chin and protect it
- Don't over rotate beyond the point that the shoulder meets the chin
- Other hand still connects to the side of the head and protects from [[|hooks]]
	- Hand is glued to the forehead
	- This allows for the other elbow to end up in the armpit crevasse
- Meant to slash across the opponents forehead / temple and open up a gash
