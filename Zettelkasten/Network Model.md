# Network Model

- Was debated between [[relational database |relational model's]] and the network model as to which were the best solution to the limitations of hierarchical models (where records are nested inside records like [[JSON]])
- A record can have multiple parents
- Hierarchical model that allows for many to one and many to many relationships
- Links between records are pointers in a programming language 
- Only way to access a record is follow a path from the root record along a chain of links called an access path
- Deprecated and out of fashion. Too difficult to make changes to the underlying data model
