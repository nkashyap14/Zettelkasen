## Definition:

- Accomplished by training multiple models using the same algorithm and training data but varying up hyperparameter values
- Resulting models are evaluated against some performance metric (accuracy being one), and then the best performing model is selected
- In Azure Machine learning can tune hyperparameters by submitting a script as a [[sweep job]]
