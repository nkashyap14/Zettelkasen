# Anaerobic Workout 1

###### General goal of Workout and Why

- The goal of this workout is to increase my overall [[VO2 Max]] and increase my ability to output more work in [[Martial Arts]]
## Exercise Choices and Why

- 400 meter sprints
- Familiar from cross country. Roughly 1:30-2 minutes of intense work that should reach near my max heart rate
- Can also do this with varying distances if I want to focus on aerobic as well

## Intensity + progressive Overloading

- At 10mph starting
- Starting with 8
- Ways I can overload moving forward will be I can either reduce rest time aka reduce cycle time or increase speed or even add a slight incline on the treadmill
## Volume

- Start with 8 at 3:30 minute rest cycles so every 3:30 minutes I run another
- Should ideally lead me to do ~ 12 minutes of work wtih 12 minutes of rest
## Rest Intervals

- 3 minutes rest
## Training Frequency

- One time a week on the treadmill right now
