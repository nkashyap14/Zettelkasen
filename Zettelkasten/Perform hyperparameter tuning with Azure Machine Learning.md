# Perform hyperparameter tuning with Azure Machine Learning

## General Details

- Depending on the model may need to specify [[hyperparameter|hyperparameters]] to configure how the model is trained
	- IE logistic regression utilizes a regularization rate hyperparameter to counteract overfitting
	- Batch size in deep learning techniques
	- learning rate to determine how much weights are adjusted during training
