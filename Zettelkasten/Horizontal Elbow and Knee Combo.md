# Horizontal Elbow and Knee Combo

- Step Jab
- Step jab
- [[Stepping Jab Cross]]
	- Can start from this point as well
	- This brings you into range for hooks to the body
- [[Lead Hand Body Hook]]
- [[Rear Horizontal Elbow]]
- Next the goal is a [[lead switch knee]]
- While you are in the motion of switching your lead leg to back leg your rear elbow should retract to the back of your head
- The lead hand simultaneously should be reaching across and grabbing the cross side of a bag or back of a persons head. This will allow for you to leverage the force to bring the lead knee into the opponents liver
- If you end up in a good base you can send another [[Rear Horizontal Elbow]]
