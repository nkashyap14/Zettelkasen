# overfitting

- Occurs when an [[Zettelkasten/Algorithm]] fits too closely or even exactly to its training data resulting in a model that can't make accurate predictions or conclusions from any data other than the training data
- Means the model is not [[generalizable]]
- The model has start to learn [[statistical noise]] or irrelevant information from within the training data
- Low error rates and high [[Variance]] are good indicators of overfitting
- If training data has low error rate and test data has high error rate it indicates overfitting
