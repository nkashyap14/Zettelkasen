# Datalink Layer

- Also referred to as layer 2
- Revolves around node to node data transfer and error detection
- The role of this layer is to ensure data is transferred reliably and accurately
- Has the role of [[framing data]]
	- Encapsulates network layer data packets into frames and adds headers + trailers
- Manages [[MAC Addresses]]
	- Unique identifiers assigned to [[network interface cards]] to allow for identification of devices on the same network
- [[Switches]] utilize mac addresses to forward to the right device
- Protocols:
	- [[Ethernet]]
	- [[PPP (Point to Point)]]
- This layer acts as a bridge between the [[Physical Layer]] and the more abstract layers above it
