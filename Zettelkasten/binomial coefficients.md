$$ \binom{n}{k}*k! = \frac{n!} {(n-k)!} = (n)! * (n - 1)! * ... * (n - k + 1)!$$

- First formula tells us the amount of possible ways to order a subset of k elements from a set of n  elements
- Second formula tells us the number of k sized subsets you can make from a n sized [[set]]# binomial coefficients
$$ \binom{n}{k}*k! = \frac{n!} {(n-k)!} = (n)! * (n - 1)! * ... * (n - k + 1)!$$

$$
\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k} = total number of subsets = 2^n
$$
