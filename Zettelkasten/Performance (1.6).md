# Performance (1.6)

## General 

- Data center managers are often interested in increasing [[Throughput]] or [[bandwidth]]
	- total amount of work done in a time
- Almost all commputers are constructed using a clock that determines when events take place in the hardware
	- These discrete time intervals are called [[clock cycles]]
- Designers can face tradeoffs between number of clock cycles needed for a program and the length of each clock cycle ([[Clock Period]])
	- Techniques to decrease number of clock cycles might increase hte length of a clock cycle
- Execution time depends on the number of [[Instruction]]s in the program
- Execution time can be likened to the number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instructions

## Subtopics
