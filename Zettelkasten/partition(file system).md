# partition(file system)

- In the context of disk management partitions are segments of a physical storage device [[Hard Disk Drives]] or [[Solid State Drives]] that are logically separated from each other
- Each partition acts as an independent disk allowing us to organize data, manage file systems, and install multiple operating systems
- Helps us optimize disk usage, improve performance, and ensure data isolation
- Tools like [[fdisk]] and [[gdisk]] are used to create, delete, resize, and manage partitions
