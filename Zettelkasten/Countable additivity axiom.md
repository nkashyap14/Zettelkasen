# Countable additivity axiom

- Given a countable sequence of [[mutually exclusive]] [[event]]s A1, A2, A3, ..., where the intersection of any two distinct events is an empty set (i.e., Ai ∩ Aj = ∅ for all i ≠ j), the countable additivity axiom states that the probability of the union of all these events occurring is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities. This concept is essential in understanding how probabilities can be combined for mutually exclusive events in a sequence.

```plaintext
P(union from i=1 to infinity of Ai) = sum from i=1 to infinity of P(Ai)
```
