# Reason's to use Euler's Number

- Exponential Growth and Decay
	- Processes that grow or decay at a rate [[Directly Proportional]] to their current size are naturally described by functions involving [[Euler's number]]
	- [[Derivative]] + [[Integral]]s
		- e^x is unique because its derivative and integral are the same as the original function
		- Makes euler's number important in [[calculus]]
