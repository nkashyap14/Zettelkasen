# The Power Wall (1.7)

## General Details

- Both [[clock rate]] and [[power]] increased for microprocessors over 36 years before plateauing
	- They are correlated
	- Recent slowing is because we have run into a practical limit for cooling commodity [[microprocessors]]
- PostPC era critical resource is energy
- Energy metric [[joules]] is a better measure than a power rate like [[watts]]
- Dominant technology for [[Integrated Circuit|integrated circuits]] is called [[CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor)]]
	- Primary source of consumption is dynamic energy
		- Energy consumed when [[Transistor|transistors]] switch states from 0 to 1 and vicec versa
- While clock rate and power were growing they were not growing at same factors
	- Clock rate at factor of 1000
	- Power at a factor of 30
	- Reason is 
		- Energy and power can be reduced by lowering the [[voltage]] which occurred with each generation of technology
		- Power is a function of voltage squared and typically voltage was reduced roughly 15% per generation
- Further lowering of voltage makes transistors too leaky and today 40% of power consumption in server chips is due to leakage
