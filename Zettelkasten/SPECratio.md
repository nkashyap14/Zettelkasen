# SPECratio

## Definition:

- Dividing the execution time of a reference processor by the execution time of the measured computer normalizes the execution time measurements
	- [[Normalization]]
	- Bigger numeric results indicates faster performance
		- As it shows the reference processor is that much slower than the measured computer or the measured computer is x times faster
- Inverse of [[CPU Execution time for a program]]
