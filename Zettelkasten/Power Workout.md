# Power Workout

## Summary

- Power is a function of speed and strength
	-  Speed * strength
## Subtopics

- [[Strength Workout 1]]
- [[Power Workout 1]]
## Details

- Modifiable variables for workouts:
	- Choice:
		- Exercise choice
			-  Deadlifting would be better for strength development not best choice for something like long duration endurance development
			- Single joint isolation movements are not best for developing power
			- Want to improve quads? Do  something like goblet squats
			- Need to consider movement pattern and what muscle groups you are hitting to prioritize
			- For endurance
				- Ideally choose concentric exercises like cycling, swimming, rowing as opposed to something like running which is more eccentric which has a greater chance of muscle damage soreness etc
				- Running uphill is more concentric than eccentric compared to something like downhill
				- For normal people oriented towards health 150-180 minutes of zone two cardio is ideal
					- barely have a conversation
				- Zone two cardio does not block hypertrophy/strength gains so can do it daily
					- before or after strength training is fine. idt doesn't matter
						- Concurrent training:
						- Interference effect study with [[Bob Hickman]] and [[John Holloszy]]
						- 3 groups, 1 strength training, 1 steady state cardio/endurance, 1 group combined
						- strength group maxximized strength gains, running maximized vo2 max and endurance marker gains
						- combined group/concurrent taining (hypertrophy/strength stacked on top of some steady state endurance) had the same improvements in VO2 max but lower increases in strength than hypertrophy
							- a running exercise will effet more than a very low zone 2 cycling
				- Roughly 1 time a week need to do a workout that gets us to our max heart rate minimum.
					- Can even do it 4 times a week
					- 220 - age: for me 220 - 28 = 192
					- Ideally 4-8 bouts of 90 econds max heart rate workoust
					- This type of workout is very complementary with hypertrophy training
		- Intensity
			- Percentage of 1 Rep Max
			- Percentage of Maximum Heart Rate
			- Percentage of VO2 Max
			- Can use conversion charts to determine one rep max
			- Is the primary driver of strength
			- Is the variable that differentiates between power focused and strength focused
				- Strength 85%+ of your max
				- Power has to be a lot lighter as you are moving towards the velocity end of the spectrum
					- 40-70% range +-
				- Can have same volume
		- Volume:
			- How many reps
				- If going for [[Hypertrophy]] then a repetition rep range of somewhere between 5-30 reps per set could be good
				- For hypertrophy have to go to muscular failure + then also need enough rest for the adaptation and protein synthesis to occur
			- How many sets
			- Minimum threshold is 10 working sets per muscle group per week
			- Probably want more like 15-20
			- For well trained 20-25
			- For speed power strength something as simple as 3-5 exercises per workout for 3-5 reps for 3-5 sets with 3-5 minutes of rest in between 3-5 times a week could be enough
		- Rest Intervals
			- Amount of time in between a set
			- Would have high rest intervals in strength workouts
				- 2-4 minutes
		- Progression/[[Progressive Overload]]
		- Training Frequency
			- Training frequency depends on what adaptation you are seeking
			- For strength:
				- Minimum viability is 2 times per week for muscle group
				- Can do every single day
				- 3 is great 2 is effective
			- Hypertrophy/Muscle size? Hedge twoards recovery
				- [[Protein Synthesis]]/Building of new tissue takes time, 48-72 hours
			- Because intensity is the primaary driver of strength frequency can be as high as you want if seeking strength. Can train every single day the exact same muscle
			- Frequency is not that important in that you can have lower frequency workouts but be fine as long as you get to same total volume. Issue is total volume gets harder to hit as you haev to do more work in that one workout
