# Seven Great Ideas in Computer Architecture

## 1 : Use Abstraction to Simplify Design
- Hid lower level details to offer a simpler model at higher levels
## 2 : Make the Common Case Fast
- Optimize the common case first before optimizing the rare case as it will lead to better enhancements to performance
## 3 : Performance via Parallelism

## 4 : [[Hierarchy of Memories]]
- Fastest, smallest, and most expensive memory per bit at the top of the hierarchy and the slowest, largest, and cheapest per bit at the bottom of the hierarchy.
## 5 : Performance via Pipelining
## 6 : Performance via Prediction

## 7 : Dependability via Redundancy
