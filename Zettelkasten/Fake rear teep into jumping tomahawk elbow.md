# Fake rear teep into jumping tomahawk elbow

- This is a riskier strike than its corresponding strike off the [[Fake lead teep into jumping tomahawk elbow]]'
	- At least for me as I lack the body control and find myself off balance and open to counter strikes in the immediate aftermath
	- Can leave chin exposed
- Same body mechanics for a jump as the [[superman punch]]
- After the jump drop the rear elbow on the opponent
- Requires immense control
