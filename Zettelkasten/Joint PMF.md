# Joint PMF

- Gives us the probability that any numerical outcome pair happens

$$
P_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x \cap Y=y)
$$

$$
p_X(x) = \sum_yp_{X,Y}(x,y)
$$
- Fix a certain value of x. To get the total probability you have to sum over the values of Y
- Above would be the marginal PMF
$$
P_{X|Y}(x|y) = P(X = x |Y=y) = \frac{p_{X,Y}(x,y)}{p_Y(y)}
$$
