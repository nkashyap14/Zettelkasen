# Dynamic Energy Formula

## Definition:

$$
Energy \approx Capacitive Load * Voltage^2
$$
	- Represents the equation of a pulse during logic transition of 0 -> 1 -> 0 or 1 -> 0 -> 1
	- Single transition = same formula * 1/2

- Total [[Power]] required per [[transistor]] thus becomes
$$
Power \approx \frac{1}{2} * Capacitive Load*Voltage^2*Frequency Switched
$$
- Frequency Switched is a function of the [[clock rate]]
- [[Capacitive Load]] per transistor is a function of both the number of transistors connected to an output and the technology which determines the [[capacitance]] of both the wires and transistors
