# Applications

- Essentially are a [[Computer Program]] that solve practical user tasks
- Interact with [[hardware]] via system libraries
- Types of applications
	- Elastic Applications
		- Can tolerate Delays
		- Types:
			- Interactive: Application that allows us to input data and get a response
				- Ex: [[Telnet]]
			- Interactive bulk: Any application that allows us to input data and get a large amount of responses
				- Ex: [[FTP]]
			- [[Asynchronous]] : Any application that does not wait for the response to give the next instruction
	- Real time applications
		- Can't tolerate substanntial delays
