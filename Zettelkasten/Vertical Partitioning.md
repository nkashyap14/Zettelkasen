- Splitting a table into multiple tables with fewer columns and using additional tables to store columns that relate rows across tables
	- Commonly referred to as a [[join operation]]
- Can store these different tables in different nodes
- Limitations:
	- Requests that need to combine data from different tables become less efficient
