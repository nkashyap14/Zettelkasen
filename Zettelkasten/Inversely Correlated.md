# Inversely Correlated

- To be inversely correlated means that an increase in magnitude in one variable causes a corresponding drop in a different variable and the converse a decrease in the magnitude in one variable causes a corresponding rise in a different variable
- In statistical terms, this would be represented by a [[correlation coefficient]] that is less than 0. The closer the correlation coefficient is to -1, the stronger the inverse correlation between the two variables.
