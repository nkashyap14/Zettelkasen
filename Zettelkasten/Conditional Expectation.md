# Conditional Expectation

- Just ordinary expectations applied to a new style of model
- All [[Properties of Expectation]] hold
- Conditional expectation of a linear function of a random variable is going to be linear function of the conditional expectations
$$
P_{X|A}(x) = P(X = x | a)
$$
$$
E[X|A] = \sum_{x}x*p_{X|A}(x)
$$
