# Muay Thai Stance

- Palms facing towards opponent
	- can be adapted to a high guard similar to what [[Tiago Beowulf]] has taught me 
	- However hands out ideally for hand fighting purposes
- Ankle is underneat the knee when in muay thai as it allows for easier checking
- When ankle is in front of the knee it is more akin to a [[Boxing Stance]] as then there is more foot mobility however it does not lend itself to checking kicks
