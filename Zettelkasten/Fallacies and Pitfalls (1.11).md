# Fallacies and Pitfalls (1.11)

## General Details

- Pitfall: Expecting the improvement of one aspect of a computer to increase overall performance by an amount proportional to the size of the improvement
- Fallacy: Computers at low utilization use little power
	- Specially configured computers in 2020 still use 33% of peak [[power]] at 10% of load the same as in SPEC2012
- Fallacy: Designing for performance and designing for energy efficiency are unrelated goals
	- Energy is [[power]] over time so optimizations that take less time save energy overall even if optimization takes a bit more energy when used
	- Reduced time can save the energy of the whole system
