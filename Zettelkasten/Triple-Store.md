# Triple-Store

- Similar to [[Graph Database |graph models]]
- All info stored in form (subject, predicate, object)
- Subject is equivalent to a vertex in a graph
- Object is one of two things
	- Value in a primitive datatype
	- Another vertex in a graph and the predicate defining a relationship like a label in an edge
		- ie (Lucy, married_to, Bob)
		- Lucy is the subject, bob is the object or another vertex and married_to is the label that defines the edge between the two
