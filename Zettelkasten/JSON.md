# JSON

- Stands for [[Javascript]] Object Notation
- Is a subset of Javascript
- Uses colon-separated key-value pairs to describe data attributes
- Language independent and has a lower learning curve than [[XML]]. Parses faster than XML and is comparatively more lightweight and compact
- Limitations:
	- Lacks a standardized wa to define and reuse descriptions for documents
	- Lacks built in way to distinguish between numbers and floats
	- Doesn't support precision beyond 253 for a 64 bit numeric representation
