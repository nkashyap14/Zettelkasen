# Fallacies of distributed computing

- [[Network]] is [[reliability|reliable]]
	- Hardware can fail. Networking protocols like [[TCP]] give us the belief that the network won't fail. It will
- [[Latency]] is zero
	- Large difference in latency between call to a remote system and to [[RAM|local memory]] access
- [[bandwidth|Bandwidth]] is infinite
- Network is secure
- Topology doesn't change
- There is one administrator
- Transport cost is zero
	- Transportation of data between two points incurs financial costs
- Network is homogenous
