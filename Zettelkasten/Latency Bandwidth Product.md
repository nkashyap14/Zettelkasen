# Latency Bandwidth Product

- Lets us know how many packets a link can hold
- = [[Latency]] * [[bandwidth]]
- EX: If bandwidth is = 1 Mega[[bits|bit]] per second and latency is 200 ms than [[bits]] in transit = 200 kbits. 
$$
[
200 \, \text{ms} \times 10^{6} \, \frac{\text{bits}}{\text{sec}} = 200,000 \, \text{bits}
]

$$
- If acknowledgement is required than signal [[latency]] becomes [[RTT]]
