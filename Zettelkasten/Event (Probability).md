# Event (Probability)

- Represents a [[subset]] of the sample space
- Probability is assigned to events 
- Axioms:
	- P(A) >= 0:
		- Event probability can't be 0
	- P([[Sample Space]]) <= 1:
		- Can't be greater than 1
	- Additivity:
	$$
			- [P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)]
			- if    P(A \cap B) = \emptyset\
	$$
- An event can be represented as sum of its individual subset element's probabilities
	- The total probability of a finite set of outcomes is equal to the sum of the individual probabilities of its constituent elements
