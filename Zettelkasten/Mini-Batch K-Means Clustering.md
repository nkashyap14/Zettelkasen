# Mini-Batch K-Means Clustering

## Definition:

- Regular [[K-Means Clustering]] applied to [[randomly sampled]] subsets of the data ([[mini-batches]])
- Trade off as results might not be as good as regular K-Means clustering
- In practice difference in quality is negligible so mini-batch clustering is usually the choice when dealing with large datasets
