# Combinations

- Have a big set with n elements and want to construct a subset with k elements
	- How many ways can we do this
- N person in some group, how many 5 person committees can we do in 100 person group etc
- Below is called [[binomial coefficients]]
- Tells us how many possible ways there are to create a k element subset starting with a set of n element
- First formula tells us the amount of possible ways to order a subset of k elements from a set of n  elements
- Second formula tells us the number of k sized subsets you can make from a n sized [[set]]
	$$ \binom{n}{k}*k! = \frac{n!} {(n-k)!} = (n)! * (n - 1)! * ... * (n - k + 1)!$$
$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!*(n - k)!}$$
