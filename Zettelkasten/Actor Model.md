# Actor Model

- Programming model for concurrency in a single [[process]]
- Rather than deal with [[thread|threads]] logic is encapsulated in actors
- each actor communicates with other actors by sending and receiving asynchronous messages
- Message delivery not guaranteed
- Since each actor processes one message at a time it doesnt need to worry about threads and each actor can be scheduled independently
- [[Distributed Actor Frameworks]]
