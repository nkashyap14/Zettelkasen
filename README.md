# Zettelkasten Knowledge Repository

Welcome to my **Zettelkasten Knowledge Repository**, a digital garden where I cultivate my understanding and insights across various fields of interest. This repository serves as a personal knowledge management system, inspired by the Zettelkasten method, designed to foster learning, idea development, and interdisciplinary connections.

## What is Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten, German for "slip box," is a knowledge management and note-taking method developed by sociologist **Niklas Luhmann**. It's built on the principle of linking individual notes (_Zettels_) containing insights, ideas, or information in a non-linear, network-like fashion. This method encourages the creation of a web of knowledge, where each note is interconnected with others through links, facilitating easy navigation, discovery, and the generation of new ideas.

## Purpose as a Learning System/Second Brain

The Zettelkasten serves as a "second brain," an external system to store and manage knowledge, allowing for the cognitive space to engage more deeply with learning and creative thinking. It's not just a repository but an active workspace for processing, understanding, and connecting information. By externalizing memory and thought processes, it aids in:
- Enhancing retention and recall through active engagement and repetition.
- Generating new ideas and insights by connecting disparate pieces of knowledge.
- Building a personal database of knowledge that grows and evolves over time.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured to encapsulate important bits of knowledge across several fields and subdomains that I am passionate about. It functions by categorizing notes into broad areas, making it easy to add, retrieve, and connect ideas within and across categories. The main categories include:

- **Computer Science**: Algorithms, data structures, programming paradigms, and more.
- **Economics**: Economic theories, models, case studies, and analytical tools.
- **Kickboxing**: Techniques, training routines, tactical strategies, and history of the sport.
- **And More**: This repository is not limited to the aforementioned fields. As learning is a continuous journey, I anticipate this system will expand into new areas of interest.

## Contributing and Usage

While primarily a personal knowledge management system, I welcome insights, corrections, and discussions from fellow learners and experts. Feel free to explore the notes, draw connections to your own work, or suggest improvements.

To navigate this repository, start with the index files located in each category directory. Notes are linked contextually, allowing for a web-like exploration of knowledge.

## Acknowledgements

This system is inspired by the works of Niklas Luhmann and many modern interpretations of the Zettelkasten method. It's an ongoing experiment in learning and knowledge synthesis, and I am grateful for the community of thinkers and tools that support this endeavor.
